# FoDS_Project_2021
This is a 5th sem Data Science project developed by Lavanya Sirisha, Vinamratha Pattar
and Tanmayi Doddapaneni. The project is essentially about using data mining and visualization techniques 
to extract valid information from the agriculture data collected. This can be of immense use to anyone 
who works in the agricultural sector.
The visualized data can give suggestions regarding favorable crops and make future predictions based on the
supply-demand gap, owing to various factors. The objectives we identified include-
1. Finding the production, area usage trends of different crops, etc. over the past few years and studying
the reasons associated with them.
2. Finding how the correlation between factors that affect production quantity and quality.
3. Study the behavior of crops that do not follow the general trends and show abnormalities like
reduction in production.
4. miscellaneous - Finding similar crops and similar states based on various factors.[clustering]
5. Predictions of crops that might be rarely produced and the main crops that might be
preferred by the farmers.
